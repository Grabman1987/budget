# Roadmap

Packages and gates from `SPEC.md` §11. Each task below is one cloud session and one pull request. Ready-to-paste prompts: `docs/prompts/`. Tick the boxes in the PR that completes them.

Gate 1 (specification and designs accepted by the owner): **pending owner sign-off.**

## P1 Fundament

### P1a — Repo scaffold and stack spike (`docs/prompts/P1a.md`)
- [x] npm workspaces: `apps/web`, `apps/server`, `packages/domain`, `packages/db`, `packages/ui`, `packages/fixtures` (worker later)
- [x] TypeScript strict, shared tsconfig, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest; `npm run check` = typecheck + lint + unit tests
- [x] `apps/server`: Hono app with `/health`, serves the built web app, strict CSP (`script-src 'self'`), HSTS
- [x] `apps/web`: Vite + React + TanStack Router + Query, one route rendering "Budget" in the blueprint fonts
- [x] `packages/domain/money`: cents type, de-AT formatter (`1.234,56 €`, real minus, sign option, no-cents option), arithmetic amount parser (`12,50+8,20`, `1.576`, `× ÷`, no eval) with tests ported from `design/prototype/app.js` behaviour and `reference/finance-hub/money-input.mjs`
- [x] `npm run proto` serves `design/prototype` on port 5180
- [x] Playwright set up (`npm run test:e2e`) with one smoke test
- [x] Dockerfile (Node 22, multi-stage), `fly.toml` (region `fra`, volume mount `/data`, app name from env/placeholder)
- [x] GitHub Actions: `ci.yml` (check + e2e on PRs), `deploy.yml` (on push to `main`: `flyctl deploy --remote-only`, skipped when `FLY_API_TOKEN` is not set)
- [x] Chart spike: render the Heute pace chart and one Sankey from prototype data with own SVG + d3-scale/d3-shape; note the decision in `docs/adr/0001-charts.md`

### P1b — Design tokens and blueprint primitives (`docs/prompts/P1b.md`)
- [x] Tokens from `.impeccable/design.json` / `DESIGN.md` → CSS custom properties + Tailwind theme; light and dark (`prefers-color-scheme` + manual toggle), print tokens
- [x] Self-hosted fonts from `design/prototype/fonts/`
- [x] Primitives in `packages/ui`: TitleBlock (Schriftfeld), Registers, DimensionChain (inline, with balancing of rounded parts), PartsList (Stückliste with groups and positions), RevisionTable, AmountInput (uses domain parser), Segmented, Switch, SidePanel / BottomSheet, Toast with undo, Status stamps, class swatches (need/want/future hatching)
- [x] Chart primitives: axis/graticule, line (solid/dashed/dash-dot), bars around zero, step line, band, elevation mark
- [x] Dev page `/dev/bauteile` showing every primitive in light and dark
- [x] Own regression baselines for every primitive on `/dev/bauteile` (light and dark, 1440 and 390): screenshots of our own output, **not** a comparison with `design/screens`
- [x] Title block, register row and shell chrome compared with crops of `design/screens` (masked text; `e2e/reference.spec.ts`, audit D9)
- [ ] Primitives without a matching crop in `design/screens` (amount field, panels, toast, revision table, parts list, charts, drawn Maßkette) are not compared with the prototype yet

### P1c — App shell and routing (`docs/prompts/P1c.md`)
- [x] Desktop: sidebar "Planliste" 01–05 with collapse, top bar (search Ctrl K, Posteingang with counter, + Buchung), theme toggle, profile
- [x] Mobile (< 768 px): header, tab bar, floating + button; same routes and order
- [x] Routes for all areas and registers (SPEC §3) with placeholder pages built from TitleBlock + Registers; every view has its own URL
- [x] Side panel (desktop) / bottom sheet (phone) pattern wired to a route param
- [x] Shell regression screenshots at 1440 and 390 (own baselines, `e2e/shell.spec.ts`)
- [x] Shell compared with `design/screens` (layout, not data): sidebar, top bar, title blocks and register rows at 1440, phone header at 390 (`e2e/reference.spec.ts`; the phone title strip and register row are not compared because they differ on purpose: labels are shown, 44 px touch targets)

### P1d — Database, fixtures and domain core (`docs/prompts/P1d.md`)
- [x] Drizzle schema v1 for the entities in SPEC §5, migrations, repositories; soft delete; audit log with undo; idempotency keys for imports
- [x] `packages/fixtures`: deterministic TypeScript port of the sample ledger generator in `design/prototype/reports-core.js` producing real bookings (not monthly sums) for Okt 2023 – 17.09.2026
- [x] Dev seed script loads the fixtures into SQLite
- [x] Domain: account balances from bookings, envelope month (assigned / activity / available, rollover), `alloc` (50/30/20 as twelfths), net worth series
- [x] Tests reproduce prototype figures (e.g. net worth 17.09.2026 = 84.730 €; August 2026 allocation Bedarf/Wunsch/Zukunft/Rest as in the One-Pager)

### P1e — Passkey login, security, deploy (`docs/prompts/P1e.md`)
- [x] SimpleWebAuthn registration and login, several passkeys, ten recovery codes, session cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, 30 days), step-up for sensitive actions
- [x] First-device bootstrap via one-time setup token from an environment secret; no open registration
- [x] Rate limiting on auth endpoints; audit of logins
- [x] Litestream backup to object storage (config + restore instructions in `docs/ops.md`)
- [ ] Deployed to the new Fly app; `/health` green; login works on phone and desktop (after P1f-1 and P1f-2 B1–B3; owner checklist in `docs/ops.md`)

## P1f Audit fixes (`docs/audit/2026-09-29-p1-audit.md`)

Order: P1f-1 → first deploy (after P1f-2 B1–B3) → P1f-3 before P2; P1f-4 in parallel. B5 (encrypted backup) before any real data.

- [ ] D8 remainder: ElevationMark shelf under the label, Sankey class nodes not solid for want/future
- [x] D9 honest visual comparison against `design/screens`
- [x] D10 phone layout: bottom padding under tab bar and + button, title-block fields with label, header title, register scroll cue, recovery-code sheet (owner screenshots)

Process from P1f on: one branch per task, PRs ≤ ~1.500 changed lines, tick only what the repository proves.

## P2 Kern und Migration

Starts after P1f-3 is merged. Source: YNAB export (`docs/migration/ynab-export.md`); Actual is not migrated. YNAB's categories and habits are evaluated and adapted via an owner-made mapping, not copied. The real export and the mapping never enter the repo or a cloud session. **Gate 2:** balances per account and month match YNAB to the cent; Available per target category matches the mapped YNAB categories before the rules month.

Order: P2a → P2b and P2c in parallel → P2d (parser can start right after P1f-3) → owner's import on the deployed app (after P1f-2 B5).

### P2a — Accounts and bookings (`docs/prompts/P2a.md`)
- [ ] API and repositories: accounts (type, on-budget, terms, closed), bookings with splits and transfers, payees; validation, audit, undo
- [ ] Konten › Übersicht, Einzelkonto (balance line, bookings, flags, status), Alle Buchungen (filter, search, bulk edit)
- [ ] Kontostand prüfen with "doppelt" / "fehlt" and Ausgleich booking (reconciliation snapshot)

### P2b — Capture dialog (`docs/prompts/P2b.md`)
- [ ] Buchung, Split, Umbuchung (Konto → Konto) on desktop panel and phone sheet; amount field with arithmetic; payee autocomplete with default category; keyboard flow; undo toast

### P2c — Categories and Plan › Monat (`docs/prompts/P2c.md`)
- [ ] Einstellungen › Kategorien: groups, classes, kinds, stages, targets, hide, merge (with re-assignment of bookings)
- [ ] Plan › Monat: waterfall with 9 stages, views (Stückliste, Zeit, Triage), Geld verteilen, overspending and card payment per concept §5.3

### P2d — YNAB import with mapping (`docs/prompts/P2d.md`)
- [ ] Parser for Register.tsv / Plan.tsv incl. CESU-8 emoji repair, splits, transfer pairing; synthetic fixture export in the real format
- [ ] Raw staging, mapping document (zod schema), dry run with side-by-side structure, commit as one reversible import run, idempotent re-import
- [ ] Import wizard in Einstellungen › Datenquellen (step-up), reconciliation report (Gate 2)
- [ ] Owner: category evaluation and mapping done, real import on the deployed app, Gate 2 report without difference

## P3 Planung und Steuerung
Expected payments, contacts with receivables, savings goals, rule set R01–R16 + stages, Heute page, Posteingang basics.

## P4 Datenquellen
Enable Banking adapter, CSV/XLSX import with saved mapping, worker with nightly run and catch-up, inbox items, assignment rules, source status in Einstellungen › Datenquellen.

## P5 Vermögen
Price history (yfinance + Ariva, source per price), ECB rates, trades and holdings, portfolio performance, allocation, Sparpläne, debts with extra repayment, freedom number with Soll-Pfad. **Gate 3:** returns and holdings equal Portfolio Performance.

## P6 Reports und Umstellung
The 30 reports (SPEC §7), explorer, printable sheets, parallel run with reconciliation report. **Gate 4:** one month-end without difference, then cancel YNAB, switch off the interim Actual cockpit and PP.
